## ScsmMpcPx

### Overview

The ScsmMpcPx module defines a domain-specific language that simplifies the
creation of SCSM Management Packs. The intent of this DSL is to make it much
easier for IT administrators to create simple SCSM Management Packs that
contain a small number of features (one or more workflows that can be run in
Windows PowerShell, an administrative settings property page, schedules for
the workflows, and some class definitions). This method of management pack
creation does not require Visual Studio, nor does it require use of the
SCSM Authoring tool. All work is done in the management pack definition.

### Minimum requirements

- PowerShell 3.0
- SnippetPx module
- LanguagePx module

### Installing the ScsmMpcPx module

ScsmMpcPx is dependent on the SnippetPx module. You can download and install the
latest versions of ScsmMpcPx and SnippetPx using any of the following methods:

#### PowerShellGet

If you don't know what PowerShellGet is, it's the way of the future for PowerShell
package management. If you're curious to find out more, you should read this:
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mvpawardprogram/archive/2014/10/06/package-management-for-powershell-modules-with-powershellget.aspx" target="_blank">Package Management for PowerShell Modules with PowerShellGet</a>

Note that these commands require that you have the PowerShellGet module installed
on the system where they are invoked.

```powershell
# If you don’t have ScsmMpcPx installed already and you want to install it for all
# all users (recommended, requires elevation)
Install-Module ScsmMpcPx,LanguagePx,SnippetPx

# If you don't have ScsmMpcPx installed already and you want to install it for the
# current user only
Install-Module ScsmMpcPx,LanguagePx,SnippetPx -Scope CurrentUser

# If you have ScsmMpcPx installed and you want to update it
Update-Module
```

#### PowerShell 3.0 or Later

To install from PowerShell 3.0 or later, open a native PowerShell console (not ISE,
unless you want it to take longer), and invoke one of the following commands:

```powershell
# If you want to install ScsmMpcPx for all users or update a version already installed
# (recommended, requires elevation for new install for all users)
& ([scriptblock]::Create((iwr -uri http://tinyurl.com/Install-GitHubHostedModule).Content)) -ModuleName ScsmMpcPx,LanguagePx,SnippetPx

# If you want to install ScsmMpcPx for the current user
& ([scriptblock]::Create((iwr -uri http://tinyurl.com/Install-GitHubHostedModule).Content)) -ModuleName ScsmMpcPx,LanguagePx,SnippetPx -Scope CurrentUser
```

### How to load the module

To load the ScsmMpcPx module into PowerShell, invoke the following command:

```powershell
Import-Module -Name ScsmMpcPx
```

This command is not necessary if you are running Microsoft Windows
PowerShell 3.0 or later and if module auto-loading is enabled (default).
